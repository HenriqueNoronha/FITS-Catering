# Website design and development for FITS Catering

This project was initiated with the goal to design, develop and deploy a website for the company called FITS Catering, based in Fortaleza, Brazil.
The website will be used for marketing purposes, therefore will be designed to be accessible and responsive for all devices, with great user experience.
 
## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories
    -   #### As a first time visitor:

        1. I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn about the organisation.
        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website to find content and information.
        3. I want to see original images of dishes prepared by the company to have an understanding of what kind of food they serve.
        4. I want to find links to the company's social media pages to find any previous customer comments and experiences.

    -   #### As a returning visitor:

        1. I want to find information regarding special customer requirements with specific dietary needs.
        2. I want to find a menu with the company's range of meals and dishes served.
        3. I want to find the best way to contact the organisation.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are red, blue, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Oswald is a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the 'Alternate Gothic' sans serif typefaces.
    -   #### Imagery
        - Images are important for the user to have an idea of food and dishes presentation. This is presented in the website's Gallery page.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
